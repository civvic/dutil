    "# Prev Session summary: `isolate` Tool Development\n",
    "See <a href=\"/dialog_?name=vic/dutil/explorer/isolated\" target=\"_blank\">isolated</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Create a tool that extracts specific messages from a dialog into a new isolated dialog with auto-detected dependencies, enabling focused work without context clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Built\n",
    "A working `isolate(ids)` function that:\n",
    "1. Takes message id(s) - single string, comma-separated, or list\n",
    "2. Queries Claude via `lisette` to identify missing imports/dependencies\n",
    "3. Extracts the prefix code needed to make target code runnable\n",
    "4. Creates new `.ipynb` file in current directory\n",
    "5. Returns clickable link to open isolated dialog in new tab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Implementation Details\n",
    "- Uses `Chat('claude-sonnet-4-5')` with prompt: `'Add only the minimal code needed before this to make it run:\\n```python\\n{target_code}\\n```'`\n",
    "- Parses response to extract prefix code before first target message\n",
    "- Generates filename: `{current_dialog_stem}_isolated_{timestamp}.ipynb`\n",
    "- URL format: `/dialog_?name={parent_path}/{isolated_stem}`\n",
    "- Helper functions: `_ask_llm`, `_get_nb`, `_get_isolated_paths`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "- Tested with simple function (`circle_area`) - correctly identified `import math`\n",
    "- Tested with `isolate` itself - correctly identified all deps and created stubs for unavailable functions\n",
    "- Multiple message support implemented but not extensively tested\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Test multiple message scenarios\n",
    "- Handle note messages with headers (extract section)\n",
    "- Improve LLM prompt for edge cases\n",
    "- Consider using `check_flakes` for validation\n",
    "- Add `path` and `suffix` parameter support"

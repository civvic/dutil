    "Excellent! It works. Ok, let's explore how to make a tool that can do the above even with closed (not running) dialogs. As Solveit doesn't have an endpoint (`add_runq_`, see above) we have to devise another similar solution. I mean not one that involves an endpoint, but with another strategy that involves tool use that we will develop.\n",

    "Interesting challenge! For closed dialogs, we need a different approach since we can't use the run queue endpoint. Let me think about the options:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Dialog-to-Dialog Communication**\n",
    "We could create a tool that:\n",
    "1. Opens the target dialog (if closed)\n",
    "2. Adds a prompt message to it\n",
    "3. Somehow captures the response\n",
    "4. Returns it to the calling dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "But this has issues - how do we \"capture\" the response from another dialog's execution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Shared State via Files**\n",
    "We could:\n",
    "1. Add a prompt message to the closed dialog\n",
    "2. Write a request to a shared file/queue\n",
    "3. Have a watcher process that opens dialogs with pending requests\n",
    "4. Write responses back to the shared location\n",
    "5. Read the response\n",
    "\n",
    "This feels complex and requires background processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Manual Two-Step Process**\n",
    "A simpler approach:\n",
    "1. Tool adds the prompt message to the closed dialog\n",
    "2. Tool returns instructions for user to open that dialog and run it\n",
    "3. User manually brings back the result, or we provide a second tool to fetch it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 4: Export/Import Pattern**\n",
    "1. Add prompt to closed dialog and save it\n",
    "2. Use `nbformat` to load the dialog, simulate adding it to context\n",
    "3. Make an LLM call directly from our tool\n",
    "4. Return the response\n",
    "\n",
    "Which direction interests you? Option 4 seems most autonomous but requires direct LLM API access. Option 3 is simplest but requires user interaction."

    "- Option 1, 3 are exactly what we have demonstrated above. I want a fully automated tool.\n",
    "- Option 2 is out of question, I'm only interested in in-dialog solutions.\n",
    "- Option 3 could work perfectly well. I even have an `importdlg` tool that can inject full or partial dialogs in current context already developed. But my intent is other. I don't want to contaminate the current context and delegates that kind of summarizing or discovering task to other LLMs (yourself or any of your peers).\n",

    "Ah, I see! You want a fully automated solution where we can query a closed dialog and get responses back, without contaminating the current context. Option 4 is the way forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the strategy would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the closed dialog** - Use `nbformat` or existing tools to load the dialog content\n",
    "2. **Construct a fresh context** - Build a message history from that dialog\n",
    "3. **Make a direct LLM API call** - Call Claude (or another LLM) with that context plus the new prompt\n",
    "4. **Return the response** - Give back the LLM's answer without ever polluting our current dialog's context\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a \"query closed dialog\" capability where we can ask questions about any dialog and get answers, all happening behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key questions:**\n",
    "- Which LLM API should we target? (Claude via Anthropic API, or are you using something else?)\n",
    "- Do you have API credentials already set up in the environment?\n",
    "- Should we build this as a single `query_dialog(dname, prompt)` function, or break it into smaller pieces?\n",

    "- A \"Dialog Engineering\" web application built by fast.ai\n",
    "- Dialogs are stored as `.ipynb` files (Jupyter notebook format)\n",
    "- Three message types: `code`, `note`, `prompt`\n",
    "- Uses ipykernel underneath for Python execution (Python 3.12)\n",
    "- Runs in persistent Linux containers with mounted volumes (\"instances\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Structure**\n",
    "- Each message has an `id`, `content`, `msg_type`, `output`, and various metadata flags\n",
    "- Flags include: `pinned`, `skipped`, `i_collapsed`, `o_collapsed`, `is_exported`, etc.\n",
    "- Messages can be hidden from LLM context (`skipped`) or always included (`pinned`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dialog Engineering Philosophy**\n",
    "- Users can modify any part of the dialog at any time (non-linear history)\n",
    "- The LLM sees the current state, not necessarily the chronological history\n",
    "- Messages above the current prompt are automatically in context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool/Variable System**\n",
    "- `&`backticks notation exposes Python functions as tools\n",
    "- `$`backticks notation injects variable values into context\n",
    "- Tools need type annotations and docstrings to work\n",

    "**File Format**\n",
    "Since dialogs are `.ipynb` files, they follow Jupyter notebook JSON structure:\n",
    "- `cells` array with cell type, source, outputs\n",
    "- Solveit adds custom metadata for its features (pinned, skipped, etc.)\n",

    "# SolveIt Course Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt is an AI-powered development environment that helps humans learn and build by providing assistance for writing prose, reading for understanding, and building maintainable software. The human is the agent - the AI helps you learn and create, but you don't outsource the building itself to the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its default LLM model (via lisette internally) and provides three main AI modes: **Learning Mode** (Socratic teaching style), **Standard Mode** (basic mode without optimizations), and **Concise Mode** (FastAI-style condensed responses). **Thinking Mode** is available for deeper reasoning - toggle it globally using the brain icon (🧠) in the navbar, or use Cmd+Shift+D to toggle thinking mode on/off. When thinking mode is enabled, use Cmd+Shift+Period to add \".\" prompts that will use thinking mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The implementation details of how these modes work internally are not publicly documented. They are not simple system prompts but use more sophisticated techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dialog Engineering**: The practice of crafting and refining your SolveIt dialogs to work as effectively as possible. This involves editing past LLM responses, adding suitable context, organizing messages, pinning reference materials, and structuring conversations to get the best results from the AI. It's about making each dialog a well-engineered tool for your specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dialogs as Notebooks**: SolveIt dialogs ARE literally .ipynb files stored on disk. No import/export needed - you have terminal access, git, and can edit them directly with any notebook editor. They're standard Jupyter notebooks with special separator comments for the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Types**: SolveIt has 4 message types (toggle with Cmd+Shift+J/K/L/;):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Code** (executable Python)\n",
    "-   **Note** (markdown for documentation)\n",
    "-   **Prompt** (sends to AI)\n",
    "-   **Raw** (plain text, no formatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We use \"dialog\" and \"message\" terminology to distinguish SolveIt from traditional notebooks, even though dialogs serialize to compatible .ipynb format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version Updates**: If features from demos/videos are missing, go to solve.it.com/dashboard → click the stop icon (⏹) on your instance → wait 5-10 seconds → click the play icon (▶) to upgrade to latest version. This should be your first debugging step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hardware Limitations**: Instances have 2GB RAM and 2GB storage. Cannot run LLMs locally or handle memory-intensive ML tasks (Stable Diffusion 5GB+). Use external platforms like Modal/Colab for heavy workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Keys & Credits**: For certain exercises you need your own Anthropic API key added in the Secrets section. The $5 minimum credit is usually sufficient for course work, though free credits aren't reliably offered to all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course Recordings**: The live course has finished. All 11 lessons are available as recordings for purchase. Office hours and community support continue in the Discord #solvers channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation & Setup**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Version Updates**: If features from demos/videos are missing, go to solve.it.com/dashboard → click the stop icon (⏹) on your instance → wait 5-10 seconds → click the play icon (▶) to upgrade to latest version. This should be your first debugging step.\n",
    "-   **Package Installation**: After installing packages with exclamation mark + pip install, restart the Python kernel using the restart button or press Shift+R. This is faster than stopping/reconnecting the entire instance. Alternatively, click the 'solveit' button (top left) to go to the dialog list, then reopen the dialog.\n",
    "-   **Module Caching**: Use `%load_ext autoreload` and `%autoreload 2` at start of notebook to automatically reload modules when files change, eliminating need for manual kernel restarts.\n",
    "-   **Dialog Kernel Lifecycle**: Each dialog runs in its own ipykernel process that persists independently of browser connections. Clicking the \"solveit\" button (top left) stops the current dialog's kernel and returns you to the dialog list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration & Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "Add API keys and configuration in your dashboard's \"Secrets\" section as name-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key (required for some exercises)\n",
    "-   `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key\n",
    "-   `AOC_SESSION` - Advent of Code session cookie (get from adventofcode.com → F12 dev tools → Application/Storage → Cookies → copy `session` value)\n",
    "-   `USE_VIM` - Set to `1` to enable vim keybindings (recommended only for vim power users; has SolveIt-specific quirks even if you know vim). Known quirks: Esc key behavior (in insert mode exits to normal mode, but in normal mode saves and exits editing - hitting Esc twice saves changes without executing), unpredictable initial mode (sometimes starts in normal mode, sometimes insert mode), Monaco editor vim limitations, and hjkl navigation works in normal mode but exits to cell navigation when leaving normal mode which can be disorienting\n",
    "-   `USE_KATEX` - Set to `1` for LaTeX math rendering. Use `\\(...\\)` for inline math and `[...]` or `$$...$$` for display. Set to `dollar` to use `$...$` for inline math (no whitespace inside delimiters). Works with SymPy's `display()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "These are securely stored and available as environment variables in your dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keyboard Shortcuts & Hotkeys\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Reference - Common Tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Move a cell: `x` (cut) → arrow keys → `v` (paste)\n",
    "-   Focus editor: `/`\n",
    "-   Skip cell in Run Above: Cmd+Slash (comments it out)\n",
    "-   Edit outputs: `n` or click message title bar\n",
    "-   Undo AI response: edit output → Cmd+Z\n",
    "-   Stop AI/code execution: Shift+S\n",
    "-   Find/search messages: `F` (Shift+F to clear)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Type Switching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+J: Code\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+K: Note\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+L: Prompt\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+;: Raw\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These shortcuts change the type of the current/new message, they do not create new messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution & Editing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Shift+Enter: Run/execute selected prompt or code cell and go to next message\n",
    "-   Cmd+Enter: Run/execute selected prompt or code cell and stay on current message (same as Submit button)\n",
    "-   Opt+Enter: Run/execute selected prompt or code cell and create new message\n",
    "-   Enter: Edit selected cell\n",
    "-   `r`: Re-run all code messages in the dialog (skips prompts and other message types)\n",
    "-   Shift+A / Shift+B: Run all code messages above/below current message (only executes code cells, skips prompts)\n",
    "-   Cmd+Slash: Toggle comments on code cells only (works in editor and when message selected; commented cells are excluded from batch execution)\n",
    "-   `e`: Export cell to Python file\n",
    "-   `n`: Edit individual output\n",
    "-   Shift+O: Clamp output height\n",
    "-   Shift+R: Restart Python kernel\n",
    "-   F: Open find/search modal (Shift+F to clear filters)\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Shortcuts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+D: Toggle thinking mode globally (on/off)\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+Comma: In editor, takes a screenshot of the last output\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+Period: **In editor** editing an AI output, does prefill completion (AI continues from your edited text); in editor with code selected, does super edit; when not in editor, adds \".\" prompt to continue (uses thinking mode if enabled in navbar)\n",
    "-   Brain icon (🧠) in navbar: Toggle thinking mode globally - when enabled, prompts will use extended thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editor Shortcuts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cmd+Shift+S (Mac) / Windows+Shift+S (Windows): Save files in full-page editor view\n",
    "-   ESC: Saves changes (intentional to prevent data loss - use Cmd+Z to undo instead)\n",
    "-   Shift+Tab: Show parameter info and documentation for functions\n",
    "-   Tab: Select from symbol dropdown (autocomplete list)\n",
    "-   Right Arrow: Accept GhostText AI code suggestions (inline grey text)\n",
    "-   Ctrl+Shift+Minus: Split message at cursor position (all platforms)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known Conflicts on macOS Chrome**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   CMD+Shift+L, Option+Enter may conflict with browser extensions (Bitwarden) or system shortcuts\n",
    "-   **Solutions**: Change extension shortcuts in Chrome (chrome://extensions/shortcuts), disable extensions temporarily, or use fresh Chrome profile\n",
    "-   **Chrome Extension Shortcuts**: Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts to view and modify keyboard shortcuts for all installed extensions. This is often the easiest fix for conflicts\n",
    "-   If shortcuts fail, try refreshing the page first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting SolveIt Issues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **First debugging step**: Use Chrome browser with all extensions disabled (easiest way is to use a guest profile)\n",
    "-   Browser extensions (especially Bitwarden, password managers) are the main source of keyboard shortcut conflicts and interface issues\n",
    "-   If features don't work as expected, try a fresh Chrome profile before reporting bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation & Focus**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `/`: Focus the bottom editor/input field\n",
    "-   Shift+Esc: Focus back on the message list\n",
    "-   Enter: Edit the current selected message and focus the edit\n",
    "-   Home: Select first message in dialog\n",
    "-   End: Select last message in dialog\n",
    "-   Left arrow: Collapse/fold a section (based on markdown headers)\n",
    "-   Right arrow: Expand/unfold a section\n",
    "-   `i`: Toggle collapse/expand on a single message input\n",
    "-   `c`: Copy selected messages to both SolveIt clipboard (server-side) and system clipboard (as markdown). Use with Cmd+A to quickly copy entire dialog to another system\n",
    "-   Cmd+A: Select all messages in the dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Left arrow collapses entire sections based on markdown headers, allowing you to move or delete whole sections at once. Use `i` to collapse just a single message. Cmd+Up/Down are for navigating within the editor to top/bottom line, not for dialog navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete List**: Click the info icon (ℹ️) in the SolveIt interface for the comprehensive, up-to-date list of all keyboard shortcuts for your version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working Across Dialogs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dialog runs in its own isolated Python kernel - they cannot directly share variables. To reuse code across dialogs, export to files and import. Since dialogs are .ipynb files with terminal access, treat them like normal Python development with modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exporting Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`e` key**: Hit `e` on any message to export it to a Python file, automatically kept in sync. In nbdev projects, this adds `#| export` tags instead\n",
    "-   **`%%writefile`**: Use `%%writefile filename.py` in code cells to manually create shared modules\n",
    "-   **Terminal**: Use standard file operations via terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing Across Dialogs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Import exported modules: `from filename import function_name`\n",
    "-   If Python can't find your module, add the path: `import sys; sys.path.append('/app/data')`\n",
    "-   The current directory isn't always in Python's path by default\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Full-screen editor**: Click \"show all files\" → click any text file to open Monaco editor (the same editor that powers VS Code)\n",
    "-   **Save in editor**: Cmd+Shift+S (Mac) or Windows+Shift+S (Windows)\n",
    "-   **View files**: Click \"show all files\" in dialog list, or use `ls`/`ls -la` in terminal\n",
    "-   **Monaco features**: The editor supports VS Code shortcuts, multi-cursor editing, find/replace, and other standard features. See VS Code keyboard shortcuts documentation for reference\n",
    "-   **Access Raw cell content**: Use x = read\\_msg()['msg']['content'] in a code cell directly below the Raw cell (requires from dialoghelper import \\*)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing & Exporting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publishing Dialogs**: Click \"Publish\" button to get shareable `https://share.solve.it.com/d/[hash]` URL. For running web apps, \"Copy Public URL\" is available from solve.it.com/dashboard - there's only one public URL per instance that all dialogs share (app must run on port 8000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing Shared Dialogs**: Go to dialog overview page → Upload File button → paste shared dialog URL into Upload via URL field. Don't just click the shared link directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing from GitHub**: Use upload via URL field with the raw GitHub link (not regular GitHub page). Imports with correct title and metadata directly to home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parsing Imported Notebooks**: SolveIt uses special separator comments (HTML comments with SOLVEIT\\_SEPARATOR prefix). Leave these intact when re-importing so the parser can split cells back into prompt/reply pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exporting to Python**: Hit e key on each message you want to export. Creates Python file kept up to date automatically. **Multiple messages with `e` key get combined into a single Python file.** In nbdev projects, adds export directive to cell instead so nbdev handles the export. **Note**: The exported .py file is saved in the same folder as the .ipynb dialog file. The filename is based on the dialog name, with underscores `_` replacing any invalid word characters. To view exported .py files, click \"show all files\" in the dialog overview page, or use terminal commands like `ls -la`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Editing & Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editing Messages**: Select message (click to highlight in blue) → Enter to edit → make changes → Shift+Enter to save. Works for any message type. Can also click message title bar to edit inputs/outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting Messages**: Select a message and look for the Delete all msgs below button to delete the selected message and all messages below it. You can also fold a section with i or o keys, then delete all child messages within that folded section in one operation. Useful for splitting dialogs - duplicate the dialog first, then use \"Delete all msgs below\" to keep only the sections you want in each copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell Ordering**: Cells are ordered by internal index numbers (may not be sequential). To reorder cells use keyboard shortcuts: cut (x), move up with arrow keys, then paste (v). Use markdown headers for structure or create new dialogs for different phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Undo & Version Control**:\n",
    "\n",
    "SolveIt dialogs are files on disk, not cloud documents. This means you get powerful version control options but limited undo. Think of working in SolveIt like writing code, not editing a Google Doc - you commit intentionally rather than expecting infinite undo.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Recovery (Built-in)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cut instead of delete: Use x key to cut messages, then v key to paste if needed\n",
    "-   Undo AI responses: Edit prompt output → Cmd+Z restores previous AI response\n",
    "-   That's it - no other undo functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intermediate: Checkpoints (Recommended)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Click \"Enable versioning\" to set up git for your dialog folder\n",
    "2.  Use \"checkpoint\" button to create manual commits with custom messages\n",
    "3.  Press s key to save - automatically commits to git\n",
    "4.  SolveIt stays on your current branch and squashes commits matching its auto-save message template\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced: Git Power Users**: Since dialogs are .ipynb files, use full git workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `git init` in terminal for manual control\n",
    "-   `git commit` regularly with meaningful messages\n",
    "-   `git checkout` to revert to earlier states\n",
    "-   `git branch` for experimental work\n",
    "-   Full git history and all standard git commands available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auto-save Behavior**: Dialogs save automatically every time you submit or cancel a new or edited message, and also during pretty much all actions that read or modify the dialog. This ensures your work is continuously persisted to disk. Use checkpoints or git before major changes for version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clearing Outputs**: Press **Backspace** to clear outputs from selected messages. Works with multi-message selection - select multiple messages and press Backspace to clear all their outputs at once. To clear all outputs in a dialog: press **Cmd+A** to select all messages, then press **Backspace**. Restarting the kernel (Shift+R) only clears variables, not visual outputs. Other options: 1) Edit individual outputs with `n`, 2) Use `Shift+O` to clamp output height, 3) Create new dialog for clean slate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Editing Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use the `n` key to edit individual outputs, or click the message title bar directly\n",
    "-   **Only AI prompt outputs are editable** - code cell outputs cannot be edited\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminal & Python Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal Sessions**: Can disconnect due to websocket timeouts or inactivity. Latest version has \"Terminal websocket reconnection\" improvements. If unresponsive, try refreshing (Cmd/Ctrl+R) to get latest version with better stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module Caching**: Use `%load_ext autoreload` and `%autoreload 2` at start of notebook. Automatically reloads modules when files change, eliminating need for manual kernel restarts or importlib.reload() when updating Python files through nbdev\\_export.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Input**: The `input()` function is supported in SolveIt. If you experience any issues, try updating your instance (stop and restart from the dashboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Language Support**: While optimized for Python, you can run other languages like Go, Rust, C using shell commands or Piston API for remote execution. Check David's demo at https://share.solve.it.com/d/cfdd46e50175569e95e55dcad9e1ccee for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript Testing**: Use `%%js` cell magic to run JavaScript in the browser. Put `%%js` at the top of a code cell, write JavaScript below, run with Shift+Enter. Check browser console (F12) for output. Use `%%html` for HTML snippets. Use `%%bash` for bash/shell commands. For complex testing, use browser DevTools, create test routes, or run isolated FastHTML apps on port 8000.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Packages**: SolveIt instances run without root access, so `apt-get install` and similar system package managers are unavailable. Python packages work via `!pip install`. For system-level dependencies (compilers, libraries), use pre-built binaries, conda environments, or external platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries & Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claudette**: Answer.AI's wrapper for Anthropic's Claude API with stateful chat dialogs, convenient image support, simplified tool use, prompt caching, and reduced boilerplate. Offers deep Claude integration (prefill, extended thinking, server-side tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lisette**: Wraps LiteLLM for unified access to 100+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) with multi-provider flexibility and unified interface to switch between providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Imports & Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `from dialoghelper import *` - Tools to modify current dialog: `add_msg(content, cell_type='note')`, `del_msg(idx)`, `update_msg(idx, content, cell_type=None)`, `url2note(url)`, `find_msgs(pattern)`, `read_msg()`, `tool_info()` for AI access to available functions\n",
    "-   `from fasthtml.common import *` - Complete FastHTML web framework: HTML components (`Div`, `P`, `A`, `Form`, `Input`, `Button`), routing (`@rt`), server setup (`FastHTML()`), styling (`Style`, `Link`), HTMX attributes (`hx_get`, `hx_post`, `hx_target`)\n",
    "-   `from fasthtml.jupyter import *` - Jupyter-specific FastHTML tools: `JupyUvi(app)` for serving apps, `render_ft()` for HTML rendering in cells, `nb_serve()` (deprecated), HTMX integration for interactive notebooks\n",
    "-   `from monsterui.all import *` - Pre-styled UI components with Tailwind CSS: cards, buttons, forms, modals, navigation, layouts. Provides `Card`, `Button`, `Modal`, `NavBar`, `Grid`, `Container` with built-in responsive design\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI/LLM Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `from claudette import *` - Answer.AI's Claude API wrapper: `Chat()` for stateful conversations, `claude()` for single calls, image support via `Img()`, tool use with `@tool` decorator, prompt caching, prefill responses, extended thinking mode\n",
    "-   `from lisette import *` - LiteLLM wrapper for 100+ providers: `completion()` for unified API calls, `Router()` for load balancing, model switching (`gpt-4`, `claude-3-sonnet`, `gemini-pro`), cost tracking, fallback handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utility Libraries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `from fastcore.tools import *` - Provides LLM tools to agents. Also includes Python utilities: `Path` for file operations, `L` for enhanced lists, `AttrDict` for dot notation dicts, `store_attr()` for class initialization, `patch` for monkey patching, `delegates` for parameter forwarding\n",
    "-   `import httpx` - Modern async HTTP client: `httpx.get()`, `httpx.post()`, `httpx.AsyncClient()` for concurrent requests, automatic JSON handling, timeout control, authentication support\n",
    "-   `import os` - Environment variables and system operations: `os.getenv('API_KEY')`, `os.environ`, `os.path` operations, process management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data & Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `import pandas as pd` - Data manipulation: `pd.DataFrame()`, `pd.read_csv()`, data cleaning, grouping, merging, statistical operations\n",
    "-   `import numpy as np` - Numerical computing: arrays, mathematical functions, linear algebra, random number generation\n",
    "-   `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` - Plotting: `plt.plot()`, `plt.scatter()`, `plt.hist()`, figure customization, subplots\n",
    "-   `import requests` - Simple HTTP requests: `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, JSON handling, session management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `tool_info()` - Displays available dialoghelper tools in a note for AI access to current dialog manipulation functions\n",
    "-   `render_ft()` - Makes FastHTML components render as HTML in cell outputs instead of showing object representations\n",
    "-   `show()` - Alternative to `render_ft()` for rendering FastHTML components as HTML in notebooks, with optional iframe wrapping and HTMX processing\n",
    "-   `JupyUvi(app, port=8000)` - Modern FastHTML server for SolveIt (preferred over deprecated `nb_serve`)\n",
    "-   `url2note(url)` - Fetches URL content and adds as markdown note below current message, useful for incorporating web content\n",
    "-   `add_msg(content, cell_type='note')` - Programmatically add messages to current dialog (note, code, prompt, raw)\n",
    "-   `find_msgs(pattern)` - Search dialog messages by content pattern, returns matching message indices\n",
    "-   `Chat()` - Create stateful Claude conversation that maintains context across multiple exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context & Message Management**:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Context window**: SolveIt only sends messages _above_ the currently selected message to Claude as context. Working at the bottom includes MORE context (all messages above), while working higher up includes LESS context. Adding messages earlier doesn't increase context for subsequent prompts.\n",
    "-   **Pinning messages**: Serves three purposes: 1) **Context preservation** - pinned messages stay available even when long dialogs get truncated due to token limits, 2) **Export control** - pinned messages are excluded from exports (Python files, gists, published dialogs), 3) **Bulk management** - pinning a collapsed header pins all child messages too. Use for API docs, examples, and reference materials.\n",
    "-   **Hiding messages**: Use the 👁️ button to hide individual messages from AI context. Like pinning, hiding also propagates to child messages when you hide a collapsed/folded section. To hide children but keep the heading visible: fold the section → hide it (propagates to all children) → unfold → unhide just the heading.\n",
    "-   **Find/search**: Press `F` when in selection mode (not editing) to open find modal. Supports regex search, filtering by message type, and searches both inputs and outputs (including collapsed content). When a match is found inside a collapsed section, it will automatically be expanded. The colored buttons in the find modal filter messages by type (note/prompt/code/raw) - the colors match those used in the SolveIt UI. Press `Shift+F` to clear filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment & Hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Options**: For small-medium apps use pla.sh (Answer.AI's deployment platform). For larger scale (100k+ users), Jeremy recommends dedicated servers from companies like Hetzner to keep things simple without opaque third-party proprietary systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Hosting**: Not supported. According to Answer.AI team: \"We currently do not support self hosting and we dont have plans to do that as of now.\" SolveIt is cloud-only with free access until early 2026 (exact date TBD), then ~$10/month.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU Workloads**: SolveIt has 2GB storage limit, so use external platforms like Modal/Colab for GPU operations. The community has created excellent dialogs showing how to use Modal - check published gists and shared dialogs for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discord Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**SolveItBuddy Activation**: Only activates when someone starts a message with `!ask` (normal helpful mode) or `!asks` (sassy mode). It does NOT activate automatically - only responds to these explicit commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Debugging Step**: Use Chrome browser with all extensions disabled (easiest way is to use a guest profile). Browser extensions (especially Bitwarden, password managers) are the main source of keyboard shortcut conflicts and interface issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working**: Try Chrome guest profile first. Known conflicts on macOS: CMD+Shift+L, Option+Enter may conflict with browser extensions or system shortcuts. If shortcuts fail, refresh the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can't Interact With Imported Notebook**: If you can open a notebook but can't run cells or edit, the issue is usually problematic outputs (especially from JupyUvi/FastHTML apps) or cell inputs containing HTML/HTMX/CSS/JS that interferes with the interface. Solution: Open in Jupyter and clear all outputs, then re-import. To debug which cell is problematic: open in Jupyter, delete half the cells, test if it works, then keep halving the problematic section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duplicate Dialogs**: Dialog duplicates can occur due to auto-save sync issues or browser/connection problems. Since dialogs are .ipynb files, safely delete duplicates from your dashboard - keep the one with your actual work. If this persists, refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl+R) to get the latest version with sync fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download Files**: In the dialog overview page, toggle \"See all files\" to show your files. Click the menu button (three dots) next to any file and select the download button to download directly to your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upload Folders**: SolveIt doesn't have a direct folder upload feature. Workaround: zip the folder locally, upload the .zip file via \"Upload File\" button, then unzip in terminal with `unzip filename.zip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating Folders**: Two methods: 1) Use `mkdir foldername` in terminal, or 2) Create a new dialog with a path like `newfolder/dialogname` - SolveIt automatically creates the folder structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moving Dialogs to Folders**: Rename a dialog in the navbar to include a folder path (e.g., change `mydialog` to `myfolder/mydialog`) to move it into an existing or new folder. SolveIt automatically creates the folder structure if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secrets Not Loading**: Secrets are loaded when you open a dialog or terminal session. After adding a secret in the dashboard, open a new dialog or terminal and the environment variable will be available. Verify with `import os; os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course Status**: The SolveIt course ran from November 3rd, 2024 for 5 weeks (2 lessons per week) and is now complete. All 11 lessons are available for purchase as recordings. SolveIt will remain free until some time in early 2026 (exact date not yet decided), then around $10/month.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homework Submission**: Share completed work and homework submissions in the Discord #share-it channel or the relevant lesson channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer.AI Team**: Answer.AI staff includes Jeremy Howard (jeremyhoward), Johno Whitaker (johnowhitaker), Erik Gaasedelen (erikgaas.), Nate (nate.dawgg), Alexis (algal0), Kerem (turgutluk), Tommy (tommyc.xyz), Eric Ries, Rens (rensdimmendaal), and Curtis (frax\\_\\_\\_). Jeremy and Johno are the most active in Discord support.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Resources**: Jeremy's personal development and software craft resources are linked in the Lesson 1 YouTube description and the #announcements channel on Discord.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictation Tools**: Jeremy recommends MacWhisper (especially with the Parakeet model) for Mac users. Windows users should use the built-in \"voice typing\" feature. For better accuracy with technical terms, use MacWhisper's \"AI-Service\" feature with an LLM (like free Gemini from Google) for smart transcript fixups using custom prompts, rather than basic dictionary replacements.\n",

    "\n",
    "# FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I pass a full directory as context to SolveIt?** A: Use `toolslm.xml.folder2ctx()` (recommended by Answer.AI). Install with `!pip install toolslm`, then use `from toolslm.xml import folder2ctx`. Example: `folder2ctx('/app/data/my_folder', file_glob='*.md')` returns XML-formatted context optimized for Claude. Supports filtering by file type, recursive search, and regex patterns. For GitHub repos, use `toolslm.xml.repo2ctx('owner/repo')` to fetch and format entire repositories as context. See docs: https://answerdotai.github.io/toolslm/xml.html#folder2ctx\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use OAuth APIs like Spotify in SolveIt?**  \n",
    "A: SolveIt can't open browsers for OAuth authorization flows. Pre-authorize on your local machine to get access/refresh tokens, then add them to your Secrets section. Most OAuth libraries support token-based authentication without requiring browser flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I scrape JavaScript-heavy websites in SolveIt?** A: SolveIt's 2GB RAM/storage limits prevent running browser automation tools like Playwright or Selenium. For JavaScript-heavy sites, use **Browserbase** (recommended by Answer.AI) or other remote browser services. For simple scraping, use `requests`/`httpx` with `beautifulsoup4` (pre-installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I bypass YouTube rate limiting when extracting transcripts?** A: Since all SolveIt instances share the same outbound IP, YouTube blocks affect all your instances. Solutions: 1) **YouTube Transcript API with Webshare proxy** - Use `youtube-transcript-api` with `WebshareProxyConfig` (add `WEBSHARE_USER` and `WEBSHARE_PASSWORD` to Secrets), 2) **Local machine with cookies** - Export browser cookies and use `yt-dlp --cookies cookies.txt` locally, 3) **External compute** - Run on Hetzner VPS (~$5/month), Modal, or E2B sandboxes with different IPs. Cache transcripts to avoid repeated requests. Example code: https://discord.com/channels/1303610061167263814/1315535369609019412/1432636954561871963\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the recommended library for audio work in SolveIt?** A: Use **torchaudio** (recommended by Jeremy). Install with `!pip install torchaudio torchvision`. Jeremy's demo shows audio playback works even in published dialogs: https://share.solve.it.com/d/afbc25f1f3d1ea7bcf55a8320e9b62b3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the recommended way to serve FastHTML/FastAPI apps in SolveIt?**  \n",
    "A: Use `JupyUvi` for both FastHTML and FastAPI apps. Example for FastAPI: `from fastapi import FastAPI; app = FastAPI(); @app.get(\"/\") def home(): return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}; server = JupyUvi(app)`. Then visit your instance's public URL from the dashboard. JupyUvi automatically picks up new routes without server restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What's the idiomatic way to define routes in FastHTML?** A: FastHTML uses function names for route paths. For the root route, use `@rt` with a function named `index`: `@rt\\ndef index(): return \"Homepage\"`. You can also explicitly specify paths like `@rt(\"/about\")`, but FastHTML automatically maps function names to routes (e.g., `def about()` → `/about`). This is different from FastAPI - don't assume they work the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I use the index route (`/`) for my FastHTML app in SolveIt?** A: No. SolveIt itself uses the root route (`/`) to display the SolveIt interface. If you define `@rt\\ndef index()` in your app, visiting the root URL will redirect you to SolveIt's interface, not your app. Use a different route like `@rt\\ndef homepage()` (accessible at `/homepage`) as your app's entry point. When you download and run locally with `serve()`, you can change it back to `index` for the standard `/` route.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I get an Anthropic API key?** A: Go to console.anthropic.com → sign up/log in → navigate to API Keys section → generate new key → add $5 minimum credit → copy key to SolveIt dashboard Secrets section as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Open a new dialog or terminal after adding the secret for it to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I access Eric Ries' book for the SolveIt course?** A: Go to the #lesson9-v2 channel and check the first message (https://discord.com/channels/1303610061167263814/1441948926906470430/1441948937526313032) for the registration link to get your `BOOK_API_KEY` and download instructions. Add the key to solve.it.com/dashboard → Secrets section → Name: `BOOK_API_KEY`, Value: [your key]. Open a new dialog after adding the secret, then use the download code from that message to access Eric's unreleased book chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I copy secrets between instances?** A: Secrets are stored in `solveit_settings.json` in your instance root directory (`/app/data/`). Open the file in both instances (click \"show all files\" → click the file), copy the secrets section from source to destination, and save. Alternatively, manually re-enter each secret in the new instance's dashboard Secrets section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Do I need to restart my instance after adding secrets (API keys)?** A: No, you don't need to restart the instance. Secrets are loaded when you open a dialog or terminal session. After adding a secret in the dashboard, simply open a new dialog or terminal and the environment variable will be available. You can verify with `import os; os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')` in a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do I get \"NameError: name 'm' is not defined\" when using Chat(m, tools=...)?** A: The variable `m` needs to be defined as a model from the `models` list. Add `m = models[1]` (or models[0], models[2], etc.) before creating the Chat. The `models` list is automatically imported with `from claudette import *`. Some shared dialogs may be missing this setup line - look for `m = models[2]` further down in the dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I preview my FastHTML app in SolveIt without running JupyUvi?** A: Use `get_preview()` to create an inline preview of your app. Define it as: `def get_preview(app): return partial(HTMX, app=app, host=None, port=None)`, then use `preview = get_preview(app)` to create a preview function. This was shown in Johno's Lesson 4 dialog but hasn't been added to `dialoghelper` yet, so you need to define it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why does nbdev\\_export only export some of my functions?** A: Most common causes: 1) Duplicate function names with `#| export` tags - check with `grep -n \"^def \" your_notebook.ipynb`, or 2) Duplicate module files (e.g., `mymodule.py` and `mymodule (1).py`) which confuse nbdev's export process. Use `ls -la` to check for duplicate files. Note: Hiding messages (👁️) only affects AI context, not nbdev\\_export. To exclude functions from export, use Cmd+Slash to comment them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can SolveItBuddy read shared dialog URLs?** A: Yes! SolveItBuddy can read shared SolveIt dialog URLs using the read\\_url tool. The shared dialogs are accessible and can be summarized or analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why does SolveItBuddy sometimes respond with \"None\"?** A: This happens when tool usage is exhausted and there isn't time to output a written response to the user. It's a technical limitation in the response generation process, not necessarily related to content access issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What does the wrench button (🔧) do in SolveIt?** A: The wrench button enables **code editing capabilities** - it allows Claude to directly modify code cells in your dialog. When enabled, it also automatically imports and adds all `stdtools` to the AI's available tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from dialoghelper import *\n",
    "from dialoghelper.inspecttools import *\n",
    "from fastcore.tools import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes tools like `rg`, `sed`, `view`, `create`, `insert`, `str_replace`, `strs_replace`, and `replace_lines` for file operations. **Tip**: Clicking the wrench is a quick way to import dialoghelper functions like `url2note()`, `add_msg()`, etc. into your Python namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How are tools defined in SolveIt and why do I get \"tool not found\" errors?** A: Tools in SolveIt are defined using regular Python functions with docstrings and type annotations - no decorators needed. They have nothing to do with claudette. SolveIt supports fastcore's docments syntax for parameter documentation (same-line comments are optional). The \"tool not found\" errors occur when the code cells that define or import these functions haven't been executed yet. Simply run the cells containing your function definitions before using them with the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What does \"{symbol} not found. Did you run it?\" error mean?** A: This error means that `&symbol` appears somewhere in a note or prompt, which tells the AI that a function named `symbol` is available as a tool, but that symbol isn't defined in the Python namespace. It usually means that the code to define or import the function hasn't been run yet. For fastcore tools like `rg`, `str_replace`, `sed`, etc., you need to run `from fastcore.tools import *` first to make them available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I create custom line/cell magics in SolveIt?** A: Yes! Create custom magics with `@line_magic` and `@cell_magic` decorators from IPython.core.magic. SolveIt uses ipykernel (so IPython magics work) but not Jupyter Notebook/Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do `?` and `??` show the same thing in SolveIt instead of docs vs source code?** A: Import `from fastcore.docments import get_source` to get proper source code inspection. Use `get_source(function_name)` for source code viewing, which is what `??` should do in course examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I get parameter info for functions in SolveIt?** A: Press **Shift+Tab** while typing a function name to see parameter information and documentation. This works like standard Jupyter/IPython behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I accept code completion suggestions in SolveIt?** A: SolveIt has two types of code completion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Symbol dropdown** (list of available variables/functions): The dropdown should auto-open as you type. Press **Cmd+I** to manually request it to open. Press **Tab** to select from the dropdown list.\n",
    "2.  **GhostText AI suggestions** (inline grey text): Press **Right Arrow** to accept the AI-generated code completion\n",
    "\n",
    "GhostText only works in Standard/Concise modes (disabled in Learning mode) and was significantly improved in the Nov 9th update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is Jeremy's teaching approach for the SolveIt course?** A: Jeremy uses the **fast.ai top-down teaching method** (not bottom-up) that they've refined over nearly a decade, based on Harvard research by education expert David Perkins. Students start with working examples and gradually break them down layer by layer. Students should **actively experiment with the code at each step** down the abstraction hierarchy, not just watch. There's executable code from the very start - by using and understanding the highest levels first, the context is understood for each subsequent layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Does Answer.AI have company rules?** A: No. Answer.AI doesn't have formal company rules. The \"30-minute rule\" mentioned elsewhere in the FAQ is a guideline (ask for help after being stuck 30 minutes), not a company rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How can I bookmark or save Discord messages for later reference?** A: Discord lacks proper bookmarking, but several workarounds exist: 1) Right-click message → \"Copy Message Link\" to get jump URLs you can save elsewhere, 2) Create your own Discord server and forward important messages to it for organization, 3) Use Discord's search function with keywords, 4) Screenshot and save messages, or 5) Copy content to external note-taking apps like Notion or Obsidian.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What are the instance sharing and access options in SolveIt?** A: SolveIt provides three ways to share/access instances from the dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Copy Public URL** - Copies the public URL for web apps running on port 8000 (format: `https://abc123def456.solveit.com/`). Only one public URL per instance. Visitors can see the app but NOT access your code/dialogs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  **Share button** - Opens dialog to add users by email. Shared users can access and collaborate on your instance code/dialogs (requires SolveIt account login).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  **Lock icon (Allow Guests)** - Click the lock icon to enable public guest access to your entire instance. Anyone with the URL can view, edit, and run ALL dialogs without authentication or SolveIt account. Equivalent to \"share with everyone.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice: Use dedicated instances for collaboration with guest mode, keep main work in private instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I access my JupyUvi app publicly?** A: After running `JupyUvi(app)` on port 8000, go to solve.it.com/dashboard and click \"Copy Public URL\" to get the actual public URL. You cannot use localhost:8000 or get the URL from the JupyUvi instance itself - the dashboard is the only way to get the public URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I run multiple FastHTML apps on different ports in one SolveIt instance?** A: No. Only port 8000 is accessible in SolveIt - other ports (8001, 8002, etc.) are not exposed even for internal access within your instance. To run multiple apps, either: 1) Combine them into a single FastHTML app with different route prefixes (`@rt('/app1')`, `@rt('/app2')`), or 2) Use separate SolveIt instances (each gets its own port 8000 and public URL).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How can I set up Tailscale to connect SolveIt with my local machine?** A: Check out Mat Miller's comprehensive shared dialog at https://share.solve.it.com/d/33792186a41abf38e1bc5a7ab3ec939c which covers setting up SSH, Tailscale, WebDAV file sharing, and Cloudflare Tunnels in SolveIt. This enables secure networking between SolveIt and your local machines, including running code interactively on remote compute like GPU workstations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I connect SolveIt to remote GPUs for fastai course work?** A: Several community dialogs show Tailscale + remote kernel workflows: 1) **RemoteDocker\\_TailscaleGuide** (https://share.solve.it.com/d/03a1e3d3551214c46662678f73264b24) - controlling Docker remotely via Tailscale, 2) **Tailscale Setup Guide** (https://share.solve.it.com/d/c3a4aecc8e9e1b3a0c8bd99379fe3c11) - userspace Tailscale setup with SSH, 3) **Remote Kernel with Tailscale** (https://share.solve.it.com/d/1bd2f90d0f48861c4ed0dd6d3125f86f) - connecting to local Jupyter kernels, 4) **fastai Lesson 6** (https://share.solve.it.com/d/38b3cfba2f3c2abab411b642b05e70d1) - random forest & timm models with remote GPU, 5) **Remote Kernel Template** (https://share.solve.it.com/d/e017ebc54623d4f4d9a92ba04011326c) - minimal template with plot/tqdm support. These show practical fastai course integration with remote compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why did I find duplicate dialogs in my dashboard?** A: Most commonly, you accidentally pressed the `d` key which duplicates the selected dialog. You can safely delete unwanted duplicates from your dashboard. In rare cases, duplicates can occur due to auto-save sync issues - if this persists, refresh your browser (Cmd/Ctrl+R) to get the latest version with sync fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I undo an accidental dialog duplication?** A: If you accidentally press `d` or click the \"Duplicate Dialog\" button, a new duplicated dialog opens with a red \"DELETE and close\" button in the navbar. Click this button to immediately delete the duplicate and return to the original dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I use the checkpoint button in SolveIt?** A: Click \"Enable versioning\" in any folder (root or subdirectory) to set up git for that location. You can create nested git repos (repo-in-repo) at any level using the GUI - this works fine. After enabling, the button changes to \"checkpoint\" for manual commits with custom messages. Pressing `s` saves and commits to git. SolveIt stays on your existing branch (main by default) and squashes commits matching the special \"s\" key commit message template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I include variable values in AI context?** A: Use dollar-backticks in prompts to include variable contents. The syntax is: dollar sign + backtick + variable\\_name + backtick (no spaces). When you use this syntax in a prompt, SolveIt evaluates the variable and sends only the current value to the AI. If you later change the variable and use the syntax again, only the new value is sent - the old value is NOT preserved in the conversation history. The AI only sees whatever the current value is at the time each prompt is sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I make Python functions available as tools to Claude in SolveIt?** A: Use ampersand-backticks in **prompts or notes** to make functions available as tools. The syntax is: ampersand + backtick + function\\_name + backtick (no spaces). The function must be defined and executed in a code cell before using it. Functions need docstrings and type annotations (simple types only: str, int, float, bool, list, dict). No decorators needed - just regular Python functions. `tool_info()` creates a note that registers useful dialoghelper functions as tools for AI access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I display images in SolveIt notebooks?** A: Use `/static/` URLs in FastHTML components - they map to `/app/data/` and work automatically in SolveIt without needing JupyUvi running. Example: `Img(src='/static/myapp/image.png')` accesses `/app/data/myapp/image.png`. Use `show()` from `fasthtml.jupyter` to render: `show(Img(src='/static/image.png'))`. Upload images via \"show all files\" or terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Are collapsed cells included when publishing dialogs?** A: Yes, collapsed cells appear expanded in published dialogs. There's currently no way to keep sections collapsed or omit them from published versions. To exclude content from published dialogs: duplicate the dialog → delete unwanted sections → publish the cleaned-up version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I provide images and PDFs to AI prompts?** A: **Images**: Paste directly into Note or Prompt messages - SolveIt automatically makes them available to Claude. Pasted images are stored as standard Jupyter notebook attachments in the cell metadata (format: `![pasted_image_<UUID>.png](attachment:<UUID>)`). These attachments are cell-specific - they persist in the original cell but cannot be referenced from other cells. **PDFs**: Cannot be pasted directly. Extract text using Python libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber) or copy/paste content manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where are pasted images into cells saved?** A: Pasted images are stored as standard Jupyter notebook attachments in the cell metadata of the .ipynb file. The attachment data is scoped to the specific cell where you pasted the image - it cannot be referenced from other cells using the `attachment:<UUID>` format. For images you need to reuse across multiple cells, save them to disk in `/app/data/` and use `/static/` URLs instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I disable or override built-in tools like read\\_url and websearch?** A: Yes, you can override built-in tools by defining functions with the same names in your Python namespace. For example, `def read_url(*args, **kwargs): return \"Disabled\"` would shadow the built-in read\\_url tool. This works because Python's normal namespace resolution applies - user-defined functions override built-ins. Note: Importing different versions of functions like `read_link` from contextkit can also interfere with built-in tool behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I unpublish a dialog once it's published?** A: Republish an empty dialog with the same file path to replace content, or contact Answer.AI team through Discord for manual removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where can I submit feature requests, bug reports, or feedback for SolveIt?** A: Use the **#solveit-app** channel in Discord - this is where the Answer.AI team (especially Jeremy Howard) actively sees and responds to feature requests, bug reports, and suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How long is the SolveIt course?** A: The course ran from November 3rd, 2024 for 5 weeks (2 lessons per week) and is now complete. All 11 lessons are available for purchase as recordings. SolveIt will remain free until some time in early 2026 (exact date not yet decided), then around $10/month. Users will be given plenty of advance warning before paid subscriptions begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where can I find detailed descriptions of what each lesson covers?** A: Erik's comprehensive course distillation at https://share.solve.it.com/d/6ecacac2530f5d05e73d1cb71445278f.html covers all lessons with detailed skill lists (hard and soft skills), narrative overviews, key takeaways, and suggested homework. This is the definitive resource for understanding course content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Which lesson covers nbdev in SolveIt?** A: Lesson 6 covers nbdev. Jeremy demonstrates creating the `fhdaisy` library from scratch, using `gh` command to create repos, `nbdev_new` to initialize projects, and the full workflow from notebook to packaged library. See also: https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What does Lesson 7 cover?** A: Lesson 7 covers remote machine control and screen sharing. Topics include using `dialoghelper.capture` to share windows with AI, SSH connections between SolveIt and local machines, and building AI assistants that can interact with your local environment (including controlling applications, navigating browsers, and even operating hardware like 3D-printer-mounted microscopes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Do SolveIt instances share resources or get individual allocations?** A: Each instance gets its own separate 2GB RAM and 2GB storage allocation - resources are NOT shared across instances. You can create multiple instances for different projects, and each one operates independently with full resource isolation. **However, all SolveIt instances share the same outbound IP address**, which means rate limiting or IP blocks from external services (like YouTube) will affect all your instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I export selected cells to markdown?** A: Use the export button on messages to mark them for export, then click \"Publish\" to get a shareable URL. Add \".md\" to the published URL to view the markdown version of your exported cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can Mac users use Keyboard Maestro to fix international keyboard shortcut issues?** A: Yes! For international Mac users experiencing keyboard shortcut conflicts (like German keyboards where Cmd+Shift+Comma/Period don't work), **Keyboard Maestro** macros can intercept the problematic key combinations and execute the correct SolveIt commands. This avoids editing source files or dealing with browser cache tradeoffs. Create macros that detect the intended shortcuts and trigger the appropriate SolveIt actions programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I split a long AI response into multiple messages?** A: Use the \"Split Message\" keyboard shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+Minus** on all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux). Place your cursor where you want to split the message while editing, then use the shortcut to break it into separate messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I increase font size in SolveIt?** A: Use your browser's zoom (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus) to increase all text sizes. SolveIt has theme settings but specific font size controls may vary by version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I resize the editor input field for more typing space?** A: Click the button with diagonal arrows on the far-right of the editor header, or use **Cmd+Shift+X** (Mac) / **Windows+Shift+X** (Windows) while in the editor to expand/shrink the editor to a larger height.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I test LLM calls without waiting for API responses?** A: Use **cachy** (`pip install pycachy`) to cache LLM call results. First run makes real API calls, subsequent runs use cached responses. This gives both speed and accuracy with real data. Answer.AI does NOT use `unittest.mock` for testing - caching real responses is preferred over mocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is cachy and how does it work automatically with all libraries?** A: Cachy (install: `pip install pycachy`) caches API requests by patching `httpx.Client` and `httpx.AsyncClient` at the transport layer. Since popular SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, LiteLLM) use httpx internally, cachy automatically works with all of them without library-specific code. Just add `from cachy import enable_cachy; enable_cachy()` at the top of your notebook. It saves responses to `cachy.jsonl` and returns cached results for identical requests, making development much faster. See: https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/cachy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I get help with programming tasks in SolveIt?** A: For programming questions, **ask the AI directly inside SolveIt** - it can interact with you as you work on the problem, see your code, and help debug in real-time. This is much more effective than asking in Discord. For general SolveIt features/usage questions, use `!ask` in Discord to get help from SolveItBuddy (check the FAQ at https://fresh-bridge-completes-rnh.si.answer.ai/). For hands-on learning, copy the comprehensive features guide (https://www.fast.ai/posts/2025-11-07-solveit-features.md) into a Note message in your dialog and ask SolveIt questions about specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What do the grey numbers after \"Output:\" in code cells mean?** A: The grey numbers after \"Output:\" show **token counts** for AI prompt responses, not execution order. They indicate how many tokens were used in that particular AI response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I download a file from SolveIt?** A: In the dialog overview page, toggle \"See all files\" to show your files. Click the menu button (three dots) next to any file and select the download button to download it directly to your local machine. No need to move files to static folders or use HTTP access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where do uploaded files go in SolveIt?** A: Files uploaded to SolveIt go to `/app/data/` by default - this is the SolveIt home directory and the \"root\" path shown in the dialog list screen. However, if you're currently in a subdirectory when you upload files, they'll be saved to that subdirectory instead. Use `ls` or `ls -la` in terminal to locate uploaded files, or click \"show all files\" in the dialog overview page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why can't I interact with an imported notebook in SolveIt?** A: If you can open a notebook but can't run cells, edit, or interact with it, the issue is usually problematic outputs (especially from JupyUvi/FastHTML apps) or cell inputs containing HTML/HTMX/CSS/JS that interferes with the SolveIt interface. **Solution**: Open the notebook in Jupyter and clear all outputs, then re-import to SolveIt. To debug which cell is problematic: open in Jupyter, delete half the cells, test if it works, then keep halving the problematic section until you find the specific cell causing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Does SolveIt support spell-checking in the editor?** A: No. SolveIt uses Monaco editor (same as VS Code), which doesn't support native browser spell-check. **Best workaround**: Add a prompt below your message asking \"Fix spelling and grammar in the message above. Keep changes minimal. Improve flow if broken. Output markdown.\" Then copy the corrected output back. This teaches you better writing while using SolveIt's AI. Alternative: Try browser extensions (Grammarly, LanguageTool) though compatibility varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I convert a prompt output into a standalone note?** A: Press the **`_` key** (underscore) when a prompt message is selected to convert its AI output into a separate note message. This is useful for preserving AI responses as documentation or reference material.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I copy code blocks from AI responses in SolveIt?** A: Press the **`m` key** when a message is selected to copy code blocks from AI responses. SolveIt has a built-in copy code button feature, similar to ChatGPT's \"copy code\" functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I extract code from function outputs (like `??` or `get_source`)?** A: Press **`w`** on code cell outputs or prompt outputs to extract fenced code blocks into new code messages (one message per code block). This is particularly useful for extracting function source code from outputs like `function_name??` or `get_source(function_name)`, or pulling code from AI responses, allowing you to immediately edit, fix, monkey-patch, or extend the extracted code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I run only code cells in a dialog?** A: Use the Find feature to filter and run code cells: Press `F` to open find modal → click the blue circle button to filter for code messages only → click the first result → Shift+End to select to bottom → run them with Shift+Enter. **Note**: Running multiple messages (>1) always skips prompts automatically - only code cells execute during batch runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Why do I get \"The following vars are undefined: [varname]\" error?** A: You're using dollar + backtick + varname + backtick (dollar-backticks, no spaces between) somewhere in a note or prompt to reference a variable that doesn't exist in your Python namespace. Either remove the reference or define the variable in a code cell before that message (e.g., varname = \"something\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: When should I use Raw messages in SolveIt?** A: Raw messages (toggle with Cmd+Shift+;) are ideal for pasting large docs as AI context - they don't create sidebar headings, trigger dollar-backtick variables, or apply formatting. Also useful for Quarto frontmatter (YAML metadata). Access content with `x = read_msg()['msg']['content']` (requires `from dialoghelper import *`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I read books written as Jupyter notebooks in SolveIt (like Think Python)?** A: Books written as Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) can be opened directly in SolveIt - no conversion needed. Simply upload the .ipynb files via \"Upload File\" button or use \"Upload via URL\" with raw GitHub links. The notebooks work natively in SolveIt where you can work through exercises in Code cells and use Learning Mode for Socratic explanations. Tools like `url2note()` and the SolveIt-Reader Chrome extension are only needed for HTML/PDF/markdown content, not for .ipynb files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I convert HTML or web pages to markdown?** A: Multiple options: 1) **url2note(url)** - Built-in SolveIt function (from dialoghelper import \\*) that fetches URL content and adds as markdown note below current message, 2) **r.jina.ai** - Prefix any URL with r.jina.ai/ (e.g., r.jina.ai/https://example.com) for instant markdown conversion, 3) **web2md.answer.ai** - Answer.AI's tool using html2text and trafilatura engines (GitHub: AnswerDotAI/web2md), 4) **Python libraries** - Install html2text or markdownify for programmatic conversion. For HTML to FastHTML code conversion, use h2f.answer.ai.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I use import\\_gist to access functions from a gist?** A: Use `import_wildcard=True` to import all functions directly into your global namespace: `import_gist('gist_id', import_wildcard=True)`. This makes functions available directly (e.g., `my_function()`) instead of requiring module access (e.g., `module.my_function()`). Without this parameter, `import_gist` returns a module object that you need to assign and access via dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I edit cell metadata in an open dialog?** A: No. You cannot edit the .ipynb file of an open dialog - SolveIt will overwrite any external changes. Use `dialoghelper` functions like `update_msg()` for content/type changes, or close the dialog first and edit the .ipynb file directly with JSON manipulation or notebook editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What is capture\\_tool and how does it work?** A: `capture_tool` is the main tool in the `dialoghelper.capture` module for taking screenshots of shared windows. Import with `from dialoghelper.capture import *`, then use `&capture_tool` (ampersand-backticks) in prompts to make it available to the AI. This is different from the **Cmd+Shift+Comma** keyboard shortcut which captures the last output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Where can I find community-created SolveIt projects and examples?** A: Check the **Community Showcase** at https://clever-fortress-comes-eb5x4e.solve.it.com/ to browse projects, dialogs, and examples shared by the SolveIt community. You can also search the #share-it channel in Discord for shared dialog links.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: What authentication methods does SolveIt support?** A: SolveIt only supports Google login. Email/password authentication is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: How do I change my email address or handle other account administration requests?** A: For account administration requests (email changes, account transfers, billing issues, or anything requiring access to personal details), email **support@answer.ai**. The Discord community cannot help with these matters due to privacy and security requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: Can I disable automatic scrolling to cells after execution?** A: Not currently. When a cell completes execution, SolveIt automatically scrolls to the output - this affects all browser windows viewing the same dialog. Press `0` (zero) to quickly jump back to the last edited message. According to Jeremy: \"Still don't have that feature - but we want to add it soon! 🙂\" For dual-monitor workflows, consider splitting work into separate dialogs which maintain independent scroll positions."

    "##### 🤖Reply🤖<!-- SOLVEIT_SEPARATOR_7f3a9b2c -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the documentation, here's what I found about message visibility for context building:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core visibility rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Position matters** - Only messages *above* the currently selected message are sent to the LLM as context. Working at the bottom = more context (all messages above), working higher up = less context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pinned messages** (`pinned=1`) - Always included in context even when long dialogs get truncated due to token limits. They're hoisted to the beginning regardless of actual position.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skipped messages** (`skipped=1`) - Hidden from LLM context (excluded from what's sent upstream).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hidden flag** (`hidden=True`) - Also excludes messages from AI context. The 👁️ button sets this.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Collapsed/clamped propagation** - When you hide (👁️) or collapse a section header, it propagates to all child messages in that section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's still unclear:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation doesn't explicitly state how `i_collapsed`, `o_collapsed`, `i_clamp`, and `o_clamp` affect context visibility. It mentions they exist and affect display (collapsing inputs/outputs, clamping height), but doesn't say whether collapsed/clamped content is *excluded* from context or just *visually hidden* in the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "My best guess: collapsed/clamped likely affects UI display only, not context inclusion. The `hidden` and `skipped` flags are the actual context filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want me to test this hypothesis by examining actual message metadata?"

    "**The caveats:** \n",
    "1. Uses a global variable (`__linked_msgs`)\n",
    "2. Doesn't persist across sessions (not serialized with the dialog)\n",
    "3. Can grow unbounded if anchor messages are deleted\n",

    "- Be a dict/AttrDict namespace for user data\n",
    "- Serialize to disk with the dialog\n",
    "- Persist across sessions\n",
    "- Be JSON-compatible with nbformat\n",

In fact, a later improvement woudl be convert the code message to a prompt message. That would be cool if possible, but later."

    "This dialog is about a feature request for Solveit: **user-controlled metadata for messages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem you're demonstrating is that when code using `add_msg()` runs multiple times, it creates duplicate messages that clutter the dialog. Your `link_msg()` solution works around this by maintaining a global `__linked_msgs` dictionary to track and update linked messages instead of creating new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this approach has issues:\n",
    "1. Uses a global variable\n",
    "2. Doesn't persist across sessions (not serialized with the dialog)\n",
    "3. Can grow unbounded if messages are deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "Your proposal is that Solveit should add a **user-controlled metadata field** to messages—a namespace (dict/AttrDict) that:\n",
    "- Users can read/write programmatically\n",
    "- Persists to disk with the dialog\n",
    "- Is JSON-compatible\n",

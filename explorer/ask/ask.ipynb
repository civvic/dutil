    "Excellent! It works. Ok, let's explore how to make a tool that can do the above even with closed (not running) dialogs. As Solveit doesn't have an endpoint (`add_runq_`, see above) we have to devise another similar solution. I mean not one that involves an endpoint, but with another strategy that involves tool use that we will develop.\n",

    "Interesting challenge! For closed dialogs, we need a different approach since we can't use the run queue endpoint. Let me think about the options:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Dialog-to-Dialog Communication**\n",
    "We could create a tool that:\n",
    "1. Opens the target dialog (if closed)\n",
    "2. Adds a prompt message to it\n",
    "3. Somehow captures the response\n",
    "4. Returns it to the calling dialog\n",
    "\n",
    "But this has issues - how do we \"capture\" the response from another dialog's execution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Shared State via Files**\n",
    "We could:\n",
    "1. Add a prompt message to the closed dialog\n",
    "2. Write a request to a shared file/queue\n",
    "3. Have a watcher process that opens dialogs with pending requests\n",
    "4. Write responses back to the shared location\n",
    "5. Read the response\n",
    "\n",
    "This feels complex and requires background processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Manual Two-Step Process**\n",
    "A simpler approach:\n",
    "1. Tool adds the prompt message to the closed dialog\n",
    "2. Tool returns instructions for user to open that dialog and run it\n",
    "3. User manually brings back the result, or we provide a second tool to fetch it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 4: Export/Import Pattern**\n",
    "1. Add prompt to closed dialog and save it\n",
    "2. Use `nbformat` to load the dialog, simulate adding it to context\n",
    "3. Make an LLM call directly from our tool\n",
    "4. Return the response\n",
    "\n",
    "Which direction interests you? Option 4 seems most autonomous but requires direct LLM API access. Option 3 is simplest but requires user interaction."

    "- Option 1, 3 are exactly what we have demonstrated above. I want a fully automated tool.\n",
    "- Option 2 is out of question, I'm only interested in in-dialog solutions.\n",
    "- Option 3 could work perfectly well. I even have an `importdlg` tool that can inject full or partial dialogs in current context already developed. But my intent is other. I don't want to contaminate the current context and delegates that kind of summarizing or discovering task to other LLMs (yourself or any of your peers).\n",

    "Ah, I see! You want a fully automated solution where we can query a closed dialog and get responses back, without contaminating the current context. Option 4 is the way forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the strategy would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the closed dialog** - Use `nbformat` or existing tools to load the dialog content\n",
    "2. **Construct a fresh context** - Build a message history from that dialog\n",
    "3. **Make a direct LLM API call** - Call Claude (or another LLM) with that context plus the new prompt\n",
    "4. **Return the response** - Give back the LLM's answer without ever polluting our current dialog's context\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a \"query closed dialog\" capability where we can ask questions about any dialog and get answers, all happening behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key questions:**\n",
    "- Which LLM API should we target? (Claude via Anthropic API, or are you using something else?)\n",
    "- Do you have API credentials already set up in the environment?\n",
    "- Should we build this as a single `query_dialog(dname, prompt)` function, or break it into smaller pieces?\n",
    "- Any preferences on how to handle the dialog content - full context, or some truncation/summarization strategy?\n",

    "\n",
    "**Core Concept**\n",
    "- A \"Dialog Engineering\" web application built by fast.ai\n",
    "- Dialogs are stored as `.ipynb` files (Jupyter notebook format)\n",
    "- Three message types: `code`, `note`, `prompt`\n",
    "- Uses ipykernel underneath for Python execution (Python 3.12)\n",
    "- Runs in persistent Linux containers with mounted volumes (\"instances\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message Structure**\n",
    "- Each message has an `id`, `content`, `msg_type`, `output`, and various metadata flags\n",
    "- Flags include: `pinned`, `skipped`, `i_collapsed`, `o_collapsed`, `is_exported`, etc.\n",
    "- Messages can be hidden from LLM context (`skipped`) or always included (`pinned`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dialog Engineering Philosophy**\n",
    "- Users can modify any part of the dialog at any time (non-linear history)\n",
    "- The LLM sees the current state, not necessarily the chronological history\n",
    "- Messages above the current prompt are automatically in context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool/Variable System**\n",
    "- `&`backticks notation exposes Python functions as tools\n",
    "- `$`backticks notation injects variable values into context\n",
    "- Tools need type annotations and docstrings to work\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Format**\n",
    "Since dialogs are `.ipynb` files, they follow Jupyter notebook JSON structure:\n",
    "- `cells` array with cell type, source, outputs\n",
    "- Solveit adds custom metadata for its features (pinned, skipped, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I'm less certain about:**\n",
    "- Exact schema of the custom metadata in the notebook cells\n",
    "- How `pinned` messages are serialized vs rendered in context\n",

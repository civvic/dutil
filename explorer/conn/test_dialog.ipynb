    "Hey, I'm Vic and we're going to work together in a session to undestand how Solveit interaction with the browser works. I don't mean how Solveit uses htmx/fastHTML to build its UI/UX, but the others means of connecting the user ipykernel with the Javascript running in the browser.\n",

    "1. Are you looking at how outputs from Python code cells get displayed in the browser (like plots, HTML, etc.)?\n",
    "2. Or are you more interested in bidirectional communication - like how the browser can trigger Python execution and how Python can update the browser in real-time?\n",
    "3. Do you already have some familiarity with how Jupyter/ipykernel typically handles this, or should we start from scratch?\n",

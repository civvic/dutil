    "**Python Environment**: It runs on ipykernel (like Jupyter Notebook), so features like magics and `!` shell commands work. However, Jupyter Widgets don't work. The environment runs in a persistent Linux container with a mounted volume for your home directory - this is called an \"instance\". You can install libraries with `!pip install ...` and they persist in your instance.\n",

    "**Alternative approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete removal** - Just delete the fenced blocks entirely, leaving only the surrounding prose. Simpler than replacement text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reference links** - Replace with something like `[→ code below]` or `[see message def]` to maintain flow while pointing to the actual code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collapse markers** - Use a very brief inline marker like `[…]` or just remove the blocks and let the prose flow naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conditional replacement** - Only replace if there's explanatory text between blocks; otherwise remove entirely to avoid cluttering pure code-sharing prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions about your use case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you want the same replacement text for all blocks, or different text per block?\n",
    "- Should it work on any prompt message, or only the most recent one?\n",
    "- What if you've already edited the code messages - should it still modify the prompt?\n",
    "- Do you want to preserve the language identifier (e.g., `python`) in the replacement text?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential enhancement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "What if `super_w` also added a small note at the top of each extracted code message indicating its origin, like `# from prompt abc, block 1`? This could help track provenance if you later move messages around.\n",
    "\n",
    "What direction appeals to you?"

That description was for `super_w` v1. `super_w` v2 will unravel the complete LLM response in N blocks of code intersped with notes. But I want to proceed step by step: first simply extract code blocks leaving an optional trail; second, improve the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provenance, meta-comments. Yes, at first sound interesting and cool. But SolveIt workflow is not linear, the user arranges the messages as they like. That kind of meta-comments , markers or tags could end being noise. -->EDITED<-- They should be handled transparently (to both user and LLM) by the meta-tool (SolveIt itself). For example, see below note message. I've removed your original response to this prompt (the original prompt, until the edited marker), create a note below with said response and add a meta-comment, and then proceed to edit your original response to my linking. Ideally, the user should't see anything, nor the model see that meta-comment in its context. But we users and SolveIt can do many cool things with that meta-comment, meta-note, whatever. Much how prompt cells are currently handled by SolveIt under the hood (separator)."

Once I was satisfied I had grasped the solution, and each line of the function has been chewed on, analyzed, and tested, I simply merged the relevant lines in a function.

    "**The anti-pattern you avoided:**\n",
    "- Write entire function upfront\n",
    "- Run it\n",
    "- Get error or unexpected result\n",
    "- Stare at code trying to figure out which part is wrong\n",
    "- Add print statements, rerun entire function\n",
    "- Repeat until frustrated\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you did instead:**\n",
    "1. Started with the actual data (`output` from the test prompt)\n",
    "2. Explored it interactively - looked at first 200 chars, tried regex\n",
    "3. Hit a problem (nested fenced blocks) - tested that edge case immediately\n",
    "4. Pivoted to a different approach (line-by-line parsing)\n",
    "5. Built up the solution incrementally - each cell adds one piece\n",
    "6. Verified output at each step\n",
    "7. Only after understanding the full solution, wrapped it in a function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "- **Immediate feedback** - see results of each line instantly\n",
    "- **No guessing** - you know exactly what the data looks like at each step\n",
    "- **Easy pivoting** - regex didn't work? Try something else without throwing away work\n",
    "- **Natural debugging** - problems surface immediately, not buried in a function\n",
    "- **Understanding over memorizing** - you *know* why each line works\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solveit advantage:**\n",
    "The persistent interpreter + message structure makes this natural. You can keep your exploration process visible, rerun parts, modify pieces, and the AI sees the whole journey for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is RYUFP in action - you didn't write `super_w` until you felt the pain of doing it manually and knew exactly what it needed to do."

    "\n",
    "1. **Symbol detection** - How do you envision detecting symbols in messages? Are we looking for:\n",

    "   - Variable assignments (`func_header = ...`)?\n",
    "   - Both?\n",

    "2. **Dependencies** - If I import a function that depends on other functions or imports from the same dialog, should `importdlg` automatically pull those in too? Or is that what `re_include` is for?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Message ordering** - When importing multiple symbols, should we preserve their original order from the source dialog, or sort them in some way (e.g., dependencies first)?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Duplicates** - What happens if the current dialog already has a symbol with the same name? Overwrite, skip, or error?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The collapsed header approach** - You mentioned running all messages under one collapsed header. This sounds elegant! So the idea would be to:\n",
    "   - Create a header message like `## Imported from cool_dialog`\n",
    "   - Put all imported messages under it (collapsed)\n",
    "   - Run just that header to execute everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Empty `syms`** - When `syms` is empty/not provided, import the entire dialog?\n",

    "- Runs on persistent Linux containers called \"instances\" with mounted volumes\n",

    "- **Message editing**: `msg_str_replace`, `msg_insert_line`, `msg_replace_lines`, `msg_del_lines`\n",

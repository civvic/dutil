    "**Issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Return type is too vague**: `dict[str, list[str]]` in the actual signature but just `dict` in the docstring annotation - should match\n",
    "2. **`exclude` parameter is unclear**: The signature shows `Union[Mapping, list[str]]` but the comment just says \"module or list of symbols\" - doesn't explain it can be a Mapping that will be recursively processed via `get_tool_names`\n",
    "3. **Missing context about \"current dialog\"**: What does \"current dialog\" mean? It's the IPython user namespace, but that's not clear\n",
    "4. **`only_exported` is ambiguous**: Only applies when `ns` is a module, but this constraint isn't obvious\n",

Maybe you have a tool called `isolated_workflow()` or similar that just returns a carefully designed message to you to follow. Or maybe we can use $ vars, vars whose contents you can add to your context: for example isolated_workflow (or similar) is just a var holding (possibley structured) prompt or text snippett.

    "5. Returns clickable link to open isolated dialog in new tab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Implementation Details\n",
    "- Uses `Chat('claude-sonnet-4-5')` with prompt: `'Add only the minimal code needed before this to make it run:\\n```python\\n{target_code}\\n```'`\n",
    "- Parses response to extract prefix code before first target message\n",
    "- Generates filename: `{current_dialog_stem}_isolated_{timestamp}.ipynb`\n",
    "- URL format: `/dialog_?name={parent_path}/{isolated_stem}`\n",
    "- Helper functions: `_ask_llm`, `_get_nb`, `_get_isolated_paths`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "- Tested with simple function (`circle_area`) - correctly identified `import math`\n",
    "- Tested with `isolate` itself - correctly identified all deps and created stubs for unavailable functions\n",
    "- Multiple message support implemented but not extensively tested\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Test multiple message scenarios\n",
    "- Handle note messages with headers (extract section)\n",
    "- Improve LLM prompt for edge cases\n",
    "- Consider using `check_flakes` for validation\n",
    "- Add `path` and `suffix` parameter support"
